Words
=====

Words is a simple project that uses a graph database to store grammatical structures of words, sentences and translations in order to analyse them and provide means for more effective vocabulary training.

At this point, the import of the data is semi-manual, with a web interface that allows the user to identify the individual words in a sentence and link them with their base grammatical forms.

Each sentence can have a translation in other languages, optionally also parsed into words. A sentence is at the same time the smallest translatable unit. This corresponds to the experience in the language where words often only have a certain meaning when used in phrases or expressions that one can not literally translate.
